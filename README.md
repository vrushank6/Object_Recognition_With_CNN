# Object_Recognition_With_CNN

This repository contains code for an Object Recognition project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal of this project is to train a CNN model to recognize objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Preparation
Load the CIFAR-10 dataset provided by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Data Preprocessing
Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the data, such as normalization and data augmentation, to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
3. Model Architecture
Design the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object recognition.
Configure layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
4. Model Training
Train the CNN model on the preprocessed training data.
Utilize appropriate optimization techniques (e.g., Adam optimizer) and a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
5. Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set to assess its accuracy and generalization.
Display relevant metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6. Prediction and Visualization
Generate predictions using the trained model on sample images.
Display the predicted labels along with the corresponding objects to showcase the model's recognition capabilities.
